# Name It

Having a hard time guessing a name for your startup/project, well name it got your back

Name it is basic react.js based web application that suggests project/startup names based on keywords input by user. 

If the user selects a particular suggested name, the app leads the user to [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) with the search results of that suggested name.
